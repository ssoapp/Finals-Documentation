The finals project was an open project for us to create and meet a project goal. I chose the goals "Make money" and "Become proficient at using the lasercutter." 
While I have no really met the goals of make money, I believe I am decently proficient at using the Trotec right now. 

To meet these goals, I illustrated ornaments and accessories, but also created two Christmas trees with a more sculptural or 3D design.
